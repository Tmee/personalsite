  <p class="lead">Denver, Colorado is where I call home now, but I was raised on the east coast.  I lived in Boston, MA until I moved to Vermont to attended college.  While in Vermont I earned a B.A. in Economics as well as an Advanced EMT certification.  I worked as a phlebotomist and EMT post graduation and eventually saved enough to make the move out to Colorado.  Once here I was accepted into <a href='http://turing.io' target='_blank'>Turing School of Software and Design</a>, a full time software development program in Denver, CO.  I successfully completed Turing's program and moved into my professional career.</p>
